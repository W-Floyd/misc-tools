# misc-tools
A general catchall of scripts/tools I make.


Briefly, run:
``
sudo wget -O /usr/bin/mactool https://github.com/W-Floyd/misc-tools/raw/master/mactool.sh && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/mactool
``

to download and install mactool.

Better yet would be a git clone and symlink, but I will leave that up to you.
